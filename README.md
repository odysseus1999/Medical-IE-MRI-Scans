# Medical-Image-Enhancement-

Overview
Welcome to the Medical-Image-Enhancement project! This initiative focuses on collecting and processing images from the Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset. The primary goal is to enhance the visibility of tumors within these images through the application of advanced image processing techniques. The project employs histogram equalization, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and the Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique (BCET) to optimize the visualization of tumors while improving brightness and highlighting relevant features.

Objectives
Image Collection: The project involves gathering images from the Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset, providing a diverse and comprehensive set for analysis.

Image Processing Techniques:

Histogram Equalization: Enhances the global contrast of the images, emphasizing variations and features.
CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization): Localizes contrast enhancements, particularly beneficial for highlighting subtle details in specific regions of the images.
BCET (Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique): Applies a specialized contrast enhancement technique to balance and optimize the visual representation of tumors.
Algorithm Evaluation: The project seeks to determine the most effective algorithm for tumor enhancement. By comparing the results obtained through different processing techniques, the aim is to identify the algorithm that best highlights tumors and improves image characteristics.

Integration with AI Systems: The processed images serve as valuable inputs for subsequent AI algorithms. The enhanced images are intended to facilitate accurate tumor detection and classification by providing a clearer and more informative visual representation.

Medical Diagnosis Support: The optimized images can also be utilized by medical professionals as a supplementary criterion for diagnosis. The improved visibility of tumors and enhanced features aid in better interpretation of the images, contributing to more informed medical decisions.
