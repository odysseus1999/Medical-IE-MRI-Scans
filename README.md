# Medical-Image-Enhancement

## Overview
Welcome to the Medical-Image-Enhancement project! This initiative focuses on collecting and processing images from the Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset. The primary goal is to enhance the visibility of tumors within these images through the application of advanced image processing techniques. The project employs histogram equalization, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and the Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique (BCET) to optimize the visualization of tumors while improving brightness and highlighting relevant features.

## Objectives
### 1. Project Objective:
- Goal: Enhance the visibility of tumors in MRI brain images to aid medical diagnosis.

### 2. Image Collection:
- Task: Collect MRI images from a dataset containing various brain tumor cases.

### 3. Image Processing Techniques:
- Techniques Used:
  - Histogram Equalization: Enhances brightness differences in images for better clarity.
  - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization): Focuses on highlighting fine details in specific areas of the image.
  - BCET (Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique): Balances and optimizes the visual representation of tumors.

### 4. Algorithm Evaluation:
- Objective: Test and compare the effectiveness of different image processing techniques in enhancing tumor visibility.

### 5. Integration with AI Systems:
- Purpose: Utilize enhanced images as inputs for AI algorithms to automate tumor detection and classification.

### 6. Medical Diagnosis Support:
- Benefit: Provide medical professionals with clearer images to assist in tumor diagnosis and decision-making.

### 7. Enhanced Tumor Detection:
- Outcome: Improved ability to detect tumors accurately and efficiently using computer algorithms.

### 8. Improved Interpretability:
- Advantage: Enhanced images aid doctors in better understanding the nature and characteristics of tumors.

### 9. Facilitated Treatment Planning:
- Impact: Clearer images enable doctors to plan treatments more effectively based on accurate tumor visualization.

### 10. Research Advancement:
- Contribution: Advancement of medical imaging techniques contributes to ongoing research in tumor diagnosis and treatment methods.
