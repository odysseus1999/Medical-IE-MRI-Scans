# Medical-Image-Enhancement

## Overview
Welcome to the Medical-Image-Enhancement project! This initiative focuses on enhancing the visibility of tumors within MRI brain images obtained from the Brain Tumor Classification dataset. By employing advanced image processing techniques, including histogram equalization, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and the Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique (BCET), our objective is to optimize tumor visualization to aid medical diagnosis.

  - **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization):** Highlights fine details in specific areas.
  - **BCET (Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique):** Optimizes the visual representation of tumors.

### 4. Algorithm Evaluation:
- **Objective:** Evaluate different image processing techniques to determine their effectiveness in enhancing tumor visibility.

### 5. Integration with AI Systems:
- **Purpose:** Utilize enhanced images as inputs for AI algorithms to automate tumor detection and classification.

### 6. Medical Diagnosis Support:
- **Benefit:** Provide clearer images to assist medical professionals in tumor diagnosis and decision-making.

### 7. Enhanced Tumor Detection:
- **Outcome:** Improve the accuracy and efficiency of tumor detection using computer algorithms.

### 8. Improved Interpretability:
- **Advantage:** Aid doctors in better understanding tumor characteristics, facilitating more precise interpretations and treatment plans.

### 9. Facilitated Treatment Planning:
- **Impact:** Enable more effective treatment planning based on accurate tumor visualization.

### 10. Research Advancement:
- **Contribution:** Contribute to the advancement of medical imaging techniques and ongoing research in tumor diagnosis and treatment methods.

Through collaborative efforts and innovative approaches, we aim to make significant contributions to the field of medical imaging and healthcare.
